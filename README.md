# monsters-home

This project was created as a part of my journey to learn React.js. It involves importing a list of monsters from the robohash.org website and displaying their details alongside information fetched from a JSON placeholder API. The project implements a smart search feature that dynamically filters and displays the monsters that match the user's search query.
